Vulnerability Scanner

As the first program of 2014 I bring you the new version of my ParanoicScan in its version 1.5, while some people stole the source code of the previous version of this program code, the issue is that not bother me that you used the code but only changed him the program name and the name of the author did not bother to change the names of the variables only changed the name of the author, for a moment hesitate to continue to share the code of this 2-year project working but despite that I continue to share the code of this program, besides explorer (of perlenespanol) recommended me to do another version of this program was to demonstrate that the real author so that the program has the dual function and arrange countless bugs that were in all the code.<br>
